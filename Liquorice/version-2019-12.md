#### Liqourice

##### Ingredients

 - Raw liqourice root powder ( 4 tbsp )
 - Dark syrup ( 1.5 dl )
 - Brown sugar ( e.g. muscovada ) ( 4 tbsp )
 - All-purpose flour ( 5 - 6 dl )
 - Pastis / Ouzo / anis-infused oil ( 2 - 4 tbsp )
 - Salt ( pinch )
 - Water ( 1 dl )

##### Process

 - 1) Put water in to a small kettle or a deep pan and mix in syrup, sugar, salt, anis flavouring and liquorice powder
 - 2) Bring the mixture to a low-to-medium boil and mixing it at the same time ( try to dissolve the liquorice as smoothly as possible)
 - 3) Take the pan away from the stove to cool of a bit and lower the heat a couple of notches
 - 4) Put the pan back to the stove and start mixing the flour in ( 0.5 - 1dl at the time through a sieve, mix thoroughly until mixture is smooth )
 - 5) After the flour is added and the "dough" starts to detach from the walls of the pan increase the heat slightly
 - 6) Continue mixing and cooking to drive out moisture ( when the surface starts to caramelise, fold that surface in )
 - 7) After 10-20mins (or when it starts to look somewhat dry) add some anis flavouring to the pan and mix that in (small amounts, repeat couple of times)
 - 8) Place the liquorice dough bewteen two baking sheets and roll flat with a suitable tool ( rolling pin, glass bottle etc)
 - 9) Let it cool down until room temperature and cut to pieces ( corn starch can be used as a light coating to reduce stickiness)
